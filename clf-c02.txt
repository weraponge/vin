The target candidate has up to 6 months of exposure to AWS Cloud design, 
implementation, and/or operations. This certification is ideal for candidates who are 
from non -IT backgrounds. These candidates might be in the early stages of pursuing 
an AWS Cloud career or might work with people in AWS Cloud roles.  
Recommended AWS knowledge  
The target candidate should have  AWS knowledge in  the following  areas : 
• AWS Cloud concepts  
• Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud

Refer to Appendix A for a list of technologies and concepts that might appear on the 
exam,  a list of in -scope AWS services  and features,  and a list of  out-of-scope AWS 
services  and features.  
Exam content  
Response types  
There are two types of questions on the exam :  
• Multiple choice:  Has one correct response and three incorrect responses 
(distractors)  
• Multiple response:  Has two or more correct responses out of five or more  
respons e options  
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the 
question. Distractors, or incorrect answers,  are response options that a candidate with 
incomplete knowledge or skill might  choose. Distractors  are generally plausible 
responses that match  the content area.  
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The 
exam include s 50 questions that affect your score.  
Unscored content  
The exam  include s 15 unscored questions  that do not affect your score. AWS collects  
information  about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these 
questions for future use as scored questions . These  unscored  questions are not 
identified on the exam .

Exam results  
The AWS Certified Cloud Pr actitioner (CLF -C02)  exam  has a pass or fail  designation . 
The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals 
who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.  
Your results for the exam  are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The  minimum 
passing score is 700. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole 
and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple 
exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels . 
Your score report could  contain a table of classifications of your performance at each 
section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do 
not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overa ll 
exam.  
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more 
questions than other sections have. The table  of classifications  contains general 
information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you 
interpr et section -level feedback.
